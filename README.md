### Hi there, I'm Nikola Plavšić 👋
---

- 🌱 Ever since I started High School, I fell in love with the **`code`**!
- 🧪 Always willing to try new technologies!
- ⚡ Huge fan of **React / NextJS**!
- 💧 I got highly interested in **GraphQL** as an API, I think it's a fantastic approach!
- ☄️ I Love to play games! World of Warcraft, For the **Horde**! ❤️
- 🔥 Sometimes I try other programming languages for fun

Right now I am working at **MasterLoot LLC** as a FullStack Developer, we use ✔️**MERN** as a technology stack.

##### You read well, if anyone mentions Angular, I'll simply leave the room.


## 🍺 Personal Projects
___

In the meantime I am developing my personal website which will be available at 🌙 **[plavsic.dev](https://plavsic.dev)** ⭐

Full code will be exposed in the repository with the same name, feel free to read it and reuse for your own personal projects if you'd like!
It's mostly NextJS and one of the UI libraries you can find over the web.
